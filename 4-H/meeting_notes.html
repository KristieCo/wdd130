        <h1>Meeting Notes</h1>
        <p>Here is a quick run through of our club meeting yesterday. We need to each have a power stance when showing our lambs to show that we are good leaders, have confidence, and show that we have worked hard and that our lamb has worked hard to get to the fair. A good stance is with our feet squarely under our hips, our shoulders over our hips, our arms strong at our sides, our head up, eyes forward or looking toward our judge, and by smiling with our eyes. We need to have eye to eye contact with happy eyes when we can. Look confident and like you have worked hard and know what you are doing. If you have confidence, you can convince the judge that you have worked hard, even if your lamb is a pain and does not listen very well. Show that you care for your lamb and want to help it, but keep your focus on the judge as much as possible. Convince the judge that your animal is great by keeping patience and concern for it at all times. Just keep it together the whole time if your lamb is being a pain or things are not going like you thought. You are selling yourself as a confident showman that has got this.</p>

        <p>Learn 3 different intelligible ways to say that you don't know. I have never thought of it that way before. I'm not certain, but I would like to find out. That's a good question and I should do some more research to find out. I can't say for certain.</p>
            
        <p>One reason for the 3 different intelligible ways to say that you don't know is while showing, the judge most likely will come up to each of the kids and ask them some questions. Usually, the kids should know the answer for them, but in case they don't it is always good to have many ways to say I don't know to sound more professional. Questions most commonly asked are things like: What is your lambs breed? What is your lambs name? What does your lamb eat? What do you like most about your lamb? Nothing to stress over, just be aware that it will happen and you need to be as professional as possible. Here is where you are selling yourself to the judge as a confident lamb showman.</p>
            
        <p>Don't forget, shearing Saturday, August 3 starting at 8:00 at Johnson's. He charges $10 a lamb and you will need to take care of that payment yourselves. Others charge over $20 each so if you feel like adding more for his services, feel free to. You know your budget and do what you feel is best for you. Have your lambs clean (scrub with water the night before or early that morning) so that shearing goes smoothly. Damp is ok but not dripping wet. I will update you if your scheduled times changes depending on how fast or slow our shearer is. I will be there to help him where needed. I am planning on having my kids get their buyer pictures taken this day and sent to Shay. I would consider doing that as well with your kids unless you have other plans. I think her final day getting them is August 8th and you will be on your own making them after that. She did mention that she could perhaps send you the file if you do not get pictures in to her on time.</p>
