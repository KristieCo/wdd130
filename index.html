                I am married with six fun, crazy children. And one day, hopefully not too soon hope to be a Grandma. 
                I love spending time with my family and extended family.  We do a variety of things together such as ski, snowboard, and rock climb.

                I graduated with my Information Systems Degree many years ago and have periodically taken classes to  add to my learning.  It has been a few years since I have taken a programming class or any class on campus and have been laughing all day that I actually left home today not even thinking about bringing my computer to class.  This class sounds like it is going to be a lot of fun with lots of things to learn and review from other classes that I have taken.
